### Starting Points ###

Voltage propagation starts by searching for items that have a
'.voltage' property of type 'Double' or 'Toleranced'.

The following starting points were found:

### Relative Voltages ###

Next, find all the pins and nets in the design whose voltage
is defined to be relative to something else.

No relative voltages were found.

### Propagation of Relative Voltages ###

From these relative voltages, we can compute the voltages of
other pins and nets.

### Final Check for Inconsistencies ###

Finally, check whether all the computed voltages are consistent
with what was declared in the design.

No inconsistencies found.
